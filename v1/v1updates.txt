-Created Character class with health, strength, defense, atkRating attributes.
-Created methods isAlive(), getdefense(), lowerHP(int), attack(character)
-Removed these functions and attributes from Monster.java and Protagonist.java
-Need to create functions in protagonist and Monster that set attributes and their specialized attack.
-YoRPG compiles but the game is clearly bugged

QCC
-In Character.java when the instance variables were private, Monster.java and 
Protagonist.java could not access the instance varaibles. I suspect it has to do with 
the header extends Character.
-Should the instance variables in Character.java be public or private?
